# Elements

>A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
>1. primitive expressions, which represent the _**simplest entities**_ the language is concerned with,
>1. means of combination, by which _**compound elements**_ are built from simpler ones, and
>1. means of abstraction, by which _**compound elements**_ can be named and manipulated as _**units**_.

## Syntax

The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program.

## Semantics

The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics.

1. Static Semantics

    - Defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms.
    - For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time.

1. Dynamic Semantics

### Type System

A type system defines:
1. how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types;
1. how it can manipulate those types and how they interact.
