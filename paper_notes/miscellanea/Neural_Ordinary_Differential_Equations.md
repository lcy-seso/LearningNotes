## Background

### What is an ordinary differential equation(ODE)?

An ODE is an equation that involves some ordinary derivatives, the ordinary here is as opposed to partial derivatives of a function.
* For example, if we know: $\frac{\partial{dx}}{\partial{dt}}(t) = \text{cos}t$, then what is the function $x(t)$
* In general, the basic principle to solve an ODE is _**always integration**_.
