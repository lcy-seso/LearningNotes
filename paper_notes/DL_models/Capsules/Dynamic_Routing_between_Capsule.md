## Overview

This work is inspired by introspecting of human version: human vision ignores irrelevant details by using a carefully determined sequence of fixation points.

1. This paper designs a _**multi-layer visual system**_: a parse tree-like structure on _**each fixation**_.
    - For a single fixation, a parse tree is carved(what's this?) out of a fixed _**multilayer**_ neural network.
    - Each group
1. _**Ignores**_ the issue of how these single fixation parse trees are coordinated over multiple fixations.
