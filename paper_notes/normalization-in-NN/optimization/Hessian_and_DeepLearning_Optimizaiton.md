[This fantastic blog post](http://mlexplained.com/2018/02/02/an-introduction-to-second-order-optimization-for-deep-learning-practitioners-basic-math-for-deep-learning-part-1) gives an intuitive introduction to the Hessian.

## Basic Concepts

- The quadratic form:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^TA\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{x} + c$$

- A matrix $A$ is _**positive-definite**_: $\mathbf{x}^TA\mathbf{x} > 0$ holds for every nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}$.
  - if $A$ is positive-definite, then the surface defined by $f(\mathbf{x})$ is shaped like a paraboloid bowl.

- _**Gradients**_: the gradient is the rate of change of some function (in deep learning, this is generally the loss function) in various directions.
  - the gradient is simply the slope of the function at that point.

$$f'(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}A^T\mathbf{x} + \frac{1}{2}A\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b} \tag{1}$$

- With equation(1) in hand, if $A$ is **positive-definite**, then:
  - if $A$ is **symmetric**, the above derivative is reduced to $f'(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + b$. $f(\mathbf{x})$ is minimized by the solution to $A\mathbf{x} = b$.
  - If $A$ is not symmetric, gradient descent will find a solution to the system $\frac{1}{2}(A^T+A)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$

- The second-order derivative (Hessian) is simply the derivative of the derivative. It is the rate of change of the slope.
  - in high-dimensional space, there is a different rate of change = slope for each direction.
  - The second-order derivative is a matrix.
- The Hessian represents the curvature.
  - The Hession affect the paraboloid's shape.
  - The values of $\mathbf{b}$ and $c$ determine where the minimum point of the paraboloid, but do not affact its shape.
- Possiblities of $A$:
  1. positive-definite
  1. negative-definite
  1. singular
  1. indefinite:  gradient descent methods will fail.
- The intuition of $A$ is positive-definite: **the quadratic form $f(\mathbf{x})$ is a paraboloid**.
- The Hessian matrix of local minimizer is positive definite, while the Hessian matrix of saddle points are indefinite.

_**Why symmetric positive-definite matrices have this nice property?**_

Consider the relationship between $f$ at some arbitrary point $\mathbf{p}$ and at the solution point $\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$, we can obtain:
$$f(\mathbf{p}) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{x})^TA(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{x})$$
If $A$ is positive-definite, the latter term is positive for all $\mathbf{p} \ne \mathbf{x}$. It follows that $\mathbf{x}$ is a global minimum of $f$.

## Hessian and Optimization

_**Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**_: $M\mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i\mathbf{v}_i$, where $\mathbf{v}_i$ is eigenvector and $\lambda_i$ is eigenvalue.

  - Eigenvectors and eigenvalues tell us a lot about the nature of the matrix.


In the case of the Hessian, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues have the following important properties:

- **Each eigenvector represents a direction where the curvature is independent of the other directions**.
- **The curvature in the direction of the eigenvector is determined by the eigenvalue**.
    - If the eigenvalue is larger, there is a larger curvature, and if it positive, the curvature will be positive, and vice-versa.

- **the larger the eigenvalue, the faster the convergence from the direction of its corresponding eigenvector**.

## Saddle Points [[1](#References)]

* It is believed that for many problems including learning deep nets, almost all local minimum have very similar function value to the global optimum, and hence finding a local minimum is good enough.
    * A problem has such a property is inherently non-convex: _**permutation symmetry**_ (??)
* There are exponentially many globally optimal solutions that are all permutations of the same solution.
* Saddle points arise naturally on the paths that connect these isolated local minima.
* _**Saddle points are very unstable: if we put a ball on a saddle point, then slightly perturb it, the ball is likely to fall!**_
* People believed the _**inherent noise helps in convergence**_ because it pushes the current point away from saddle points. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
