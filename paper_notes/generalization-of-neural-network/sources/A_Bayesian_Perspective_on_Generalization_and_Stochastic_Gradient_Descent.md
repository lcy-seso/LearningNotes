# [A Bayesian Perspective on Generalization and Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06451)

The question proposed in [[1](#References)]: why large neural networks generalize well in practice, and the neural network can easily memorize the random labeled training data. can be understood by the Bayesian model comparison theory.

---
First, consider a simple classification model $M$ with a single parameter $\omega$.

The authors prove that the Bayesian evidence can be approximated by (detail proof canbe found in section 2):

$$p(y|x;M) \approx \text{exp} \left\{ -\left( C(\omega_0) + \frac{1}{2}\text{ln}\left( \frac{c''(\omega_0)}{\lambda} \right) \right)\right\} \tag{1}$$

From equation (1), the evidence is controlled by:

1. the value of the cost function at the minimum
1. the logarithm of the ratio of the curvature about this minimum compared to the regularization constant


For a model contains $p$ parameters (given by [[3](#References)]):

$$ p(y|x; M) \approx \text{exp} \left\{ -\left( C(\omega_0) + \frac{1}{2}\sum^{p}_{i=1} \text{ln}\frac{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda} \right) \right\} \tag{2}$$

where:

- $C(\omega; M)$: the $L_2$ regularized cross entropy, or cost functions
- $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient
- $\omega_0$ is the minimum of the cost function
- $\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue of cost function's Hessian matrix

Insights from (1) and (2):

- the second term is often called "Occam factor."
  - it enforces Occam's razor: when two models describe the data equally well, the simpler model is usually better.
  - it describes the fraction of the prior parameter space consistent with the data
- minimal with low curvature is simple because the parameters do not have to be fine-tuned to fit the data.

## Some findings suggested in the paper:

- generalization is strongly correlated with the Bayesian evidence: the weighted combination of the depth of a minimum (the cost function) and its breadth (the Occam factor).
- the gradient drives the SGD towards deep minima, while noise drives the SGD towards the broad minima.
- the test performance shows a peak at an optimal batch size which balances these competing contributions to the evidence.
- the SGD noise scale: $g=\epsilon(\frac{N}{B}-1)\approx \epsilon \frac{N}{B}$, where $N$ is the number of training samples, $B$ is size of mini-batch, $\epsilon$ is the learning rate.
  - when we vary the batch size or the training set size, we should keep the noise scale fixed, which implies that $B_{opt} \propto \epsilon N$
  - progressively growing the batch size as new training data is collected.
- when using SGD with momentum, the noise scale : $g \approx \frac{\epsilon N}{B(1-m)}$, where $m$ is momentum.
