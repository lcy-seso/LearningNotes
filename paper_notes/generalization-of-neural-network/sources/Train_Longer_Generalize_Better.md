# [Train longer, generalize better: closing the generalization gap in the large batch training of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741)

## The problems

- what is the **<font color=#8f4586>generalization gap</font>**?
  there is a persistent degradation in generalization performance when using large batch size.

- generalizaiton gap stems from **<font color=#8080c0>the relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size</font>**.

## Theoretical Analysis

- For physical intuition, one can think of the *weight vector* $\mathbf{w}_t$ as: **a particle performing a random walk on the loss ("potential") landscape $L (\mathbf{w_t})$**.
- **<font color=#8f4586 size=5>ultra-slow diffusion</font>**: the asymptotic behavior of the [auto-covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance) of the random potential: $\mathbb{E}( L({\mathbf{w}_1}) L({\mathbf{w}_2})) \sim \parallel \mathbf{w}_1 - \mathbf{w}_2 \parallel^2$, determines the asymptotic behavior of the random walker:
$$\mathbb{E} \parallel \mathbf{w}_t - \mathbf{\mathbf{w}_0} \parallel^2 \sim (\text{log t}^\frac{4}{\alpha})$$
- typically:  $d \triangleq \parallel \mathbf{w}_t - \mathbf{w}_0 \parallel \sim \left(\text{log} t \right) ^\frac{2}{\alpha}$, where $\parallel \cdot \parallel$ is the Euclidean distance of two vector.
  - to climb (or go around) each barrier takes exponentially long time in the heigh of the barrier: $t \sim \text{exp}(d^\frac{\alpha}{2})$

## Empirical results and implications

The below figure examines $\parallel \mathbf{w}_t - \mathbf{w}_0 \parallel$ during the initial training phrase:

>In Figure 2 (in the paper), all the models are trained for a constant number of epochs, smaller batch sizes entail more training iteration in total.

Foundings in the paper:

- Weight distance from initial training phrase <font color=#8080c0>increases logarithmically</font> with the number of training iterations (weight updates): $\parallel \mathbf{w}_t - \mathbf{w}_0\parallel \sim \text{log}(t)$.
- A very similar logarithmic graph is observed for all batch sizes, however:
  1. Each batch size seems to have a different slop, indicating a somewhat **different diffusion rate for different batch sizes**.
  1. Weight distance reached at the end of the initial learning phase is significantly different for different batch sizes.

The findings lead to the flowing informal argument:

- To reach a minimal of "width" $d$ the weight vector $\mathbf{w}_t$ has to travel at least a distance $d$.
- Thus, to reach wide ("flat") minima, we need to have the highest possible diffusion rates and a large number of training iterations.

## Solutions given in this paper

>Does "Regime adaption" means: to achieve the same learning performance when using a large batch size, a longer time is required for training. If so, what is the advantage of large batch training?

## Conclusions in this paper

- Even though small batch updates still posses a desirable property of convergence to solutions with good generalization, there are no fundamental issues with big batch updates.
- A certain amount of SGD updates is required to reach a good solution. By contrast, fewer computations are required when the number of samples is small in each batch.
- Good generalization can result from the extensive amount of gradient updates in which there is no apparent validation error change, and training error continues to drop.

## Suggestion

**<font color=#D02090>Move our attention from the "generalization gap" to a more modest "computational gap" where we desire that big-batches will improve optimization time without incurring large computational overhead.</font>**
