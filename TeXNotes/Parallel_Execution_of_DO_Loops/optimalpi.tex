The hyperplane theorem proves the existence of $\pi$. So far, there is still
a problem left, the optimal $\pi$.

$k=1$ means the outermost loop is sequential while all the inner loops are parallelable.
Therefore, it is reasonable to minimize the number of steps in the outer \textit{\textbf{DO}}
$J^1$ loop(\ref{loop2}). This means minimizing $\mu^1 - \lambda^1$ in loop(\ref{loop2}).

Setting $M^i = \mu^i - l^i$, it is easy to see that $\mu^1 - \lambda^1$ equals:

\begin{equation} \label{opt}
M^1|a_1|+...+M^n|a_n|
\end{equation}

Thus, finding an optimal $\pi$ is reduced to the integer programming problem:
\textit{\textbf{find integers $a_1,...,a_n$ satisfying inequalities given by (C2)
which minimize expression \ref{opt}}}.

This problem is to find solution to the linear

For some linear Diophantine equations, it is algorithmatically solvable, but there
are no practical method of finding a solution in the general case.

Below theorem is from \cite{irigoin1988supernode}. It is referred as an important
conclusion in \cite{wolf1991loop}. I just think
the conclusion below further improves the \textbf{hyperplane concurrency theorem} by:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item propose the concept "fully permutable loop" which gives a more strigent
  conditions of loop programs are able to obtain the optimal parallelism. The
  concept "fully permutable loop" is also the foundation for tiling.
  \item give the transformation that leads to the optimal parallelism for "fully
  permutable loop".
\end{enumerate}

transformed to code containing at least $n-1$ degress of parallelism. In the
degenerate case when no dependences are carried by these $n$ loops, the degree
of parallelism is $n$.}}}
